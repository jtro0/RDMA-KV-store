The results gathered have shown an significant improvement over TCP when using RDMA.
Reliable connection transportation type has seen similar scalability to TCP, with a near 60 Ktasks/sec increase in throughput across all number of clients.
Unreliable datagram has been shown to be most promising in scalability.
With the highest throughput performance (near 60\% improvement compared to RC) and lowest latency, this transport type is easy to recommend for future RDMA key value stores.
UD also has the most potential optimizations, improving performance further.
Multiple QP connection, as needed with RC, have shown scalability issues, due to limited RNIC cache and context switching.
