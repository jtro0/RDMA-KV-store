There are several proposed RDMA KV store designs.
One of which, HERD \cite{kalia2014using}, uses a combination of transport types.
HERD uses RDMA WRITE over UC for requests and SEND over UD for responses.
Kalia et. al. have shown that WRITE offers lower latency and higher throughput compared to READ.
Outgoing WRITEs have also been shown to not scale well with increase in number of QP connections.
This confirms the poor scalability seen with RC in section \ref{subsec:scalability-rate}.

HERD out performs the RDMA KV store presented in this thesis significantly.
This could due to multiple factors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item HERD has implemented some optimizations towards prefetching before posting a SEND WR.
    With this they have observed roughly 30\% improvement, in the best case comparison (2 random memory accesses at 4 CPU cores.)
    \item Making use of one-sided WRITE for requests, bypassing the CPU.
    \item Using inlined data for key.
    Inlining small payloads decreases latency as there is no need for a DMA operation.
\end{itemize}

However, Kalia et. al. stated that performance should be comparable to SEND/SEND, given that inlining is possible.
It was found that for a large number of clients and/or requests, the round-robin polling used, is inefficient.
With 1000s of clients, a SEND/SEND design would scale better than the WRITE/SEND used in HERD.
